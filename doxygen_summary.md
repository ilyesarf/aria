# Doxygen Documentation Summary

This document summarizes the Doxygen documentation added to the Fantasy Forest game project.

## Files Documented

We've added comprehensive Doxygen documentation to the following files:

### Core Game Files
- `game/include/game.h`: Core game mechanics and data structures
- `game/include/minimap.h`: Minimap functionality
- `game/include/bgmain.h`: Background handling and camera system
- `game/src/main.c`: Main game entry point

### Supporting Files
- `menu/header.h`: Menu system for the game
- `helpers.h`: Helper utilities and common structures

## Documentation Added

For each file, we've added:

1. **File-level documentation**: Description of the purpose and contents of each file
2. **Function documentation**: 
   - Brief description
   - Parameter details
   - Return value descriptions
   - Side effects where applicable
3. **Structure documentation**:
   - Purpose of each structure
   - Field documentation for all members
4. **Enum documentation**:
   - Purpose of each enum
   - Meaning of each value
5. **Macro/Constant documentation**:
   - Purpose and usage of each constant

## Build System

We've added a Doxygen target to the Makefile:
```
make docs
```

This generates documentation based on the Doxyfile in the project root.

## Setup Files

Created the following files to help with documentation management:

- `Doxyfile`: Configuration file for Doxygen
- `docs/README.md`: Information about using the documentation
- `setup_doxygen.md`: Instructions for setting up Doxygen

## Next Steps

To complete the documentation:

1. Document remaining source files:
   - `game/src/game.c`
   - `game/src/minimap.c`
   - `game/src/bgsource.c`
   - `game/src/bgmain.c`
   - Menu implementation files

2. Generate the documentation once Doxygen is installed

3. Keep documentation updated as the code evolves
